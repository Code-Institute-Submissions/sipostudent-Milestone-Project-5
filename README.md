## About

An **issue tracker** web application that tracks bugs and feature requests.


#### Goal

An Issue tracking web application system that allows the user's to record and follow the progress of every bug or feature-request identified until the problem gets resolved. Additionally, there is the inclusion of an option for user's to donate money to fund work on future bugs, and features requests.

The core focus of this project is on functional app logic created with **Python** while utilising the **Django** framework.

#### Functionality

- Ability to create tickets for: bugs, and feature-requests.
- View and edit existing tickets.
- Ability to send money donations.
- See what the site is about and its motivation before joining. 
- View documentation to how the site functions and any faq's. 
- Alternative to sign in/sign up with a nearby profile 
- See a rundown of as of recently made tickets on users landing page 
- Make/alter/update/erase my very own tickets for a bug/highlight demand. 
- Make/alter/update/erase my very own remarks for a bug/highlight demand. 
- Donate towards an element 
- View and perform activities on the site on a cell phone easily.

#### Initiation

Research to understand what apps of similar scope were already doing in terms of functionality which provided me with a list of what I consider to be feasible options for functionality implementations to acknowledge and consider pre-production.
